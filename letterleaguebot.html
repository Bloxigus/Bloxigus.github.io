        <h1>Things to note: </h1>
        <p>
            LetterLeagueBot does not know every word used by letter league. If a word comes up as invalid in the actual game, 
            press the "Next Best Option" until a word does work
        </p>
        <p>
            Press enter on a inserted word while hovering the grid to submit that word into the grid. Any words that have no 
            point value assigned are not in the grid yet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wildcards (?) significantly increase the runtime of the program
